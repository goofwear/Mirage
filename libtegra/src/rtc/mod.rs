//! PMIC Real-Time Clock driver for the Switch's Maxim77620-RTC.
//!
//! # Description
//!
//! The Maxim77620 exposes an additional interface to the RTC over IÂ²C
//! for reading current time as accurate as possible.
//!
//! # Implementation
//!
//! - The [`RtcTime`] is a representation of such an RTC time.
//! All the attributes are publicly accessible for people who
//! want to do formatting or comparisons.
//!
//! - [`RtcTime::new`] crates a new instance of this struct, using the
//! RTC values that were read over the I2C 5 controller.
//!
//! - The [`Display`] trait is implemented for a human-readable
//! representation of the current point in time.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```
//! use mirage_libtegra::rtc::RtcTime;
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     let time = RtcTime::new();
//!
//!     println!("{:?}", time); // Saturday, November 09, 2019 17:39:36
//! }
//! ```
//!

//! [`RtcTime::new`]: struct.RtcTime.html#method.new
