//! Interface for Memory-Mapped I/O registers.
//!
//! Defines memory regions through pointers which are
//! acessed by [volatile] read/write operations.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! The [`Mmio`] struct internally wraps around an instance of
//! [`RegisterCell`] which provides unsafe [volatile] access to
//! a certain memory region.
//!
//! [`RegisterCell`] then stores an instance of [`UnsafeCell`] which is
//! supposed to manage the actually supplied pointer to a certain
//! memory region and provides [`RegisterCell::get`] and
//! [`RegisterCell::set`] which perform [volatile] reads/writes. Ideally
//! speaking, [`RegisterCell`] is designed similar to [`Cell`] from `std`.
//!
//! This makes it possible to mutate [`RegisterCell`] in immutable structs.
//! And since it is the underlying construction for the [`Mmio`] struct,
//! this applies to it as well. In other words, it enables "interior
//! mutability" for [`Mmio`]s.
//!
//! Compared to other MMIO implementations, the end user is often required
//! to dereference raw pointers, which is considered unsafe, in order to
//! operate on the registers. This implementation does the dereferencing
//! of the raw pointers internally, however explicitly marks the exposed
//! methods which create instances of the [`Mmio`] structure as unsafe
//! because falsy pointers will trigger Undefined Behavior, which should
//! be avoided.
//!
//! In practice, registers are often mapped as blocks of registers which
//! belong together. These registers can be represented nicely through
//! structures, which should implement [`VolatileStorage`]. It requires
//! you to implement [`VolatileStorage::make_ptr`] which is supposed to
//! return a pointer to the memory address where the register block starts.
//! The unsafe [`VolatileStorage::get`] method can then be used to create
//! a reference of the respectively aligned instance of the structure that
//! represents the register block.
//!
//! [`VolatileStorage::get`] is considered unsafe for reasons elaborated
//! below.
//!
//! If you only want to represent certain registers at certain addresses,
//! you can do that by casting the addresses to [`Mmio`] pointers and
//! dereferencing them.
//!
//! # Safety
//!
//! The dereferencing of raw pointers is done internally.
//! This act may result in dangling pointers, triggering Undefined Behavior,
//! which is to be avoided. And that's why it is intrinsic to pass correct
//! pointers to [`Mmio`]s which uses them to initialize [`RegisterCell`]s.
//!
//! Though end users shouldn't dereference raw pointers in their own code
//! by design, the supplied pointers nonetheless need to be correct and
//! that's why entry points to the creation of instances of the [`Mmio`]
//! structure are marked as unsafe - the general risk to trigger UB is
//! always present.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! ``` no_run
//! use mirage_mmio::*;
//!
//! // A struct that represents a memory-mapped register block.
//! // Needs to be made repr(C) so the fields get aligned correctly.
//! #[repr(C)]
//! pub struct RegisterBlock {
//!     pub some_reg: Mmio<u32>,
//!     _unknown: [Mmio<u32>; 4],
//!     pub another_reg: Mmio<u32>,
//! }
//!
//! impl VolatileStorage for RegisterBlock {
//!     fn make_ptr() -> *const Self {
//!         // Return a raw pointer to the memory region
//!         // where this register block is mapped.
//!         0xE000_000 as *const _
//!     }
//! }
//!
//!
//! fn do_xy() {
//!     let register = unsafe { &*(0xF000_0000 as *const Mmio<u32>) };
//!
//!     // The previously implemented make_ptr is needed
//!     // to create a reference to the memory-mapped
//!     // registers, which can now be accessed.
//!     let registers = unsafe { RegisterBlock::get() };
//!
//!     // Read from a register.
//!     let some_value = registers.some_reg.read();
//!     // Modify the value of another one.
//!     registers.another_reg.write(some_value << register.read());
